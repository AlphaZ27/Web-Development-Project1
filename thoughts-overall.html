			<h1 class="title5">Thoughts on the Characters and the Ending</h1>
				<p class="text5">
					This game is simply a masterpiece and it deserves all the praise it has gotten. 
					I thought the story was interesting for both playable characters and that the plot, overall, was pretty good. 
					I personally didn’t like that you had to play as Abby while she hunted down Joel in the beginning but it did make for good storytelling. 
					I really liked all the characters from Ellie’s part of the story, and only Lev and Yara from Abby’s. 
					<br>
					<br>
					All the supporting characters for Abby made me dislike her more, maybe besides Nora but even Nora was a bit dislikeable. 
					Manny annoyed me for his obnoxious insistence that Mel and Abby get along because they’re both women that are important to Owen. 
					Mel was annoying because she obviously doesn’t like Abby because of her past with Owen, I think that she’s jealous and suspects that Owen still has feelings for Abby. 
					Which, to be fair, is obviously true. Owen cheats on Mel with Abby, which just made me dislike both even more. 
					Yes, Mel is annoying but she didn’t deserve to get cheated on, especially since Owen got her pregnant. 
					There’s just something about Owen that makes him very unlikeable and I’m not sure what it is. 
					He dodges his responsibility to Mel for Abby consistently and even to Mel’s face, he sometimes acts like he is owed something and is overall frustrating. 
					Nora was the nicest of all of them and generally less annoying, the way she died was honestly terrible.
					<br>
					<br>
					Ellie’s supporting characters were probably just written to be more likeable. 
					Dina is awesome, she willingly goes with Ellie to Seattle to help her get her revenge while knowing she is pregnant. 
					Jesse goes out to bring Tommy back and then pivots to help Ellie because they’re all working towards the same thing. 
					Dina genuinely seems to care about Ellie which is great. 
					I have the least to say about them in a negative context which is a good thing.
					<br>
					<br>
					I didn’t like the ending at first. 
					But the more that I thought about it and talked with others online, I realised I did like it. 
					The whole game is about forgiveness. Ellie needing to forgive Joel for what he did in the first game, taking away her choice to decide if she wanted to die to make a cure. 
					This is Ellie’s story, yes we played as Abby for a large portion of the game but that was her journey of redemption, of bettering herself. 
					Ellie throughout her revenge storyline got progressively ruthless and unforgiving. 
					She did things that she hadn’t before, things that Joel told her that he did to survive the apocalypse. 
					She decides to kill everyone in Abby’s group that witnessed/aided in Joel’s death. She brutally killed Nora, first by getting her infected by spores and then by beating Abby’s location out of her. 
					We see Ellie break down after this, she doesn’t recognise the person that she’s become in order to get to Abby. 
					The writers clearly tried to make it seem like Ellie is a bad guy and that she is just as bad as Abby for wanting revenge. 
					They had her kill Nora the way she did, kill Mel and Owen. 
					The difference is Abby chose to perpetuate the circle of violence and revenge by killing Joel. 
					She only gets to move on after he’s dead. 
					Ellie doesn’t that chance, she hadn’t forgiven Joel and then he is taken from her before she can. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Abby continues the cycle. 
					Joel killed her dad, four years later she kills Joel, Ellie in pursuit of her, kills all the people that helped her kill Joel, Abby wants to kill Ellie for killing her friends, Abby kills Jesse, she wounds Tommy and then tries to kill Dina but is stopped by Lev. 
					This breaks the cycle from Abby’s part, she is no longer apart of the violence but Ellie hasn’t been able to break the cycle yet. 
					She still hasn’t been able to forgive Joel so she can’t let it go. 
					This is why she chooses to leave Dina and baby JJ at the farm while pursuits Abby. 
					She honestly believes that that is how she can get over his death. 
					When the time came to kill Abby it’s the flash of Joel’s face that stops her from doing it. 
					She has finally forgiven him, she can finally move on and she no longer has a reason to kill Abby. 
					That’s what I liked about it. 
					I finally <i>understood<i> why she did what she did.
