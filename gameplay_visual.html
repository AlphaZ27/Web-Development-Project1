		<p class="infoBox">
		The game features expanded traversal and stealth mechanics, including a jump button, ability to go prone and a dodge mechanic. 
		Enemy AI has been improved, notably how human enemies will often communicate with each other, relaying information about Ellie's position through whistling. 
		Crafting has also been expanded, along with new ammo types (such as explosive arrows). 
		Two noteworthy additions are an "identification meter", which, in addition to the audio cue from the first game, alerts the player to how close an enemy is to seeing them (while it's white, the player still has the opportunity to hide, but once it turns red, they have been spotted), and an "injury gauge", which indicates when the player receives a serious wound (such as an arrow to the shoulder) and must press and hold the R1 button in order to treat it. 
		Another new addition is the ability to pick up glass bottles and/or bricks, and throw them, while running.

		<p class="infoBox">
		This is one of the best looking PS4 games ever made. The character models from the first game is a huge to the second. 
		The character movements are more fluid and the particle effects a very detailed.
		The infected look so much better, the gas from the bloaters have a lot of detail. 
		The backgrounds are very detailed, there isn't a need for anything to get loaded in so every looks seemless.
